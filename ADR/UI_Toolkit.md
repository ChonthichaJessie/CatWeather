# UI ToolKit 
---
## Status
Proposed.

## Context
The team was considering the best UI toolkit for app development. The UI tool kit should include tool kit libraries that are compatible with UI design. Additionally, developers can customize their UI kits. And the team anticipated that there would be large communities for the UI Toolkit, which would allow them to reduce time consumption if they encountered any issues with the UI Toolkit.

## Decision
**Component libraries : NativeBase** 
NativeBase is a popular component library that offers creative and modern UI design. Developers can also customize properties. This UI library is well-supported by a larger community, and the documentation is straightforward.

### Consequences:
- NativeBase libraries cannot cover all of UI design; developers will still need other UI libraries to support some specific UI components.
