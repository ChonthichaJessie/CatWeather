# Architecture Decision Record: Navigation Strategy
---
## Status
Accepted
## Context
The team is tasked with determining the navigation strategy for the Weather Forecast App. Navigation is a crucial aspect of the app's user experience, and the team needs to decide on the most effective and user-friendly approach for moving between different sections of the app.
## Decision
Considering the simplicity of the Weather Forecast App and the need for quick access to different sections, a bottom tab bar navigation strategy is proposed. This approach places tabs at the bottom of the screen, allowing users to easily switch between different locations and view the current temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts without much effort. This is a common and intuitive navigation pattern, providing a straightforward user experience.
## Consequences
- **Limited Tabs**: The bottom tab bar is suitable for apps with a limited number of primary sections. In this case, the app's primary sections would include the current temperature, weather conditions, and forecast for each location.
- **Platform Consistency**: This approach aligns with the navigation patterns commonly used in mobile apps, providing a familiar experience for users.
- **Visual Clarity**: The bottom tab bar offers clear visual indicators, making it easy for users to understand the app's structure and switch between different locations effortlessly.

## Considerations
- **Scalability**: If the app evolves to include more features in the future, the team may need to reconsider the navigation strategy to accommodate additional sections.
- **Customization**: Ensure that the bottom tab bar can be customized to match the app's design and branding, maintaining a cohesive visual identity.
